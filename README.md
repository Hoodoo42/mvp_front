Created skeleton directory for mvp_front

creating my first full js game. As it is only the very beginning I plan on there being many many changes and trial and error as I go.  

My Notes:
phaser.js is the fully/commented out version of phaser.min js, and wont be used for production.
phaser.min.js is the phaser framework
